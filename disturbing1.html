		<em>THE MYSTERY OF DEATH</em><br><div>There is something that attracts me to death. The act of killing people, maybe? No, I don't think that's it.&nbsp; Seeing people die? No, no, no... I think it's the agony. Yes, the last moments of their life. I love to look them in the eyes. The despair, fear... it's a different kind of fear. Not human fear. Their fear is animal fear. The fear of a rabbit trapped inside a hole in the ground, looking outside, seeing the nose a fox peeking inside, starting to haul the dirt...</div><div><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-size: 28px;">THE FEELING OF DOOM</span></div><div>Yes... that's what really fascinates me. When I look them in the eye, I see the unavoidable. The feeling of doom. They know they're dying. They know nothing can help them now.&nbsp; They know... this is the end. This is truly the end. Nothing will save them. Life isn't a fairy tale. Nobody will come to save them. No hero will manifest in the last moment of their life and use their magic powers to rescue them. There is no hope. There is no god. There is just darkness, and they see it coming for them, as their eyes get more and more tired, closing themselves as their body slowly bleeds out, makes them sleepy, exhausted, helpless...</div><div><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-size: 28px;">THE HOPE</span></div><div>You can really tell when hope dies. When it really dies. And once you witnessed it for the first time, you'll always know. For certain. It's not like people think it feels like. They witnessed some sad things, losing family, pets, sons or daughters, maybe money, house, relationships... they just bring it up and think "this person has lost all hope". They're like "i can't imagine how they can go on now..." and think they know what they're talking about. But they don't. It takes more to truly lose hope. Much more. It's so rare to see, maybe that's what attracts me to their death. To see how hope slowly dies in their eyes... it's truly a unique experience.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-size: 28px;">&nbsp;THE BEAST INSIDE OF US</span></div><div>After they've lost their hope, something changes. Their fear... their fear changes. It goes from this panicky, terrified, screaming sound of a dying human, to this... this animal fear. It's like they lost their consciousness. Like their lost their human core. Like the humanity was ripped out of their bodies. And beneath it... just an animal. Yes... Inside, there is just this fucking animal, looking at me with his animal eyes, scraping the floor with their animal paws. Isn't it fascinating? It makes me feel like a scientist. Like I'm discovering the roots of humanity. This human being, once a business owner, an artist, architect, so full of life, so full of ideas... now just an animal. There is no more character. No more deep thoughts. Only instincts. Actions, reactions. Animals. That's what they all turn into at the end of their journey.</div><div><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-size: 28px;">ANIMAL FEAR</span></div><div>There are two kinds of fear. There is normal fear, and there is animal fear. Normal fear is a high-level emotion. It helps people develop, avoid dangers. Even in life-threatening situations. The animal fear, on the other side... it's much more of a core emotion. Something that we left behind as we evolved, but its remains are still inside of us, just forgotten, never used.</div><div><br></div><div>There was time I classified them by death or not death threatening situations. I thought animal fear is just fear of death. But my suspections were proven false. Not everyone I've seen die was experiencing animal fear. During my experiments, I've come to the conclusion that the loss of hope is the deciding factor. It's really hard to lose hope, even when dying. People always have this little light of hope no matter how dire the situation. They hope someone will save them, or maybe they trust in their god, heavens, or whatever.</div><div><br></div><div>To make them feel animal fear, you need to make them lose hope. And to make them lose hope, usually it's enough to just make them bleed slowly. So they have enough time to realize their doom. Works for most people.</div>
