Because of the implied element of rape, western nations consider it a sex crime. Other countries might classify it as an arranged marriage, forced marriage or a kidnapping. In some cases, the women cooperates with or accedes to the kidnapping, typically in an effort to save face for herself or her parents.</div><div><br></div><div>In many jurisdictions, this used to be encouraged by so-called marry-your-rapist laws.</div><div><br></div><div>In poor countries, fear of kidnapping is often citied as a reason for the lower participation of girls in the education system.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-size: 28px;">EGYPT</span></div><div>The practice of bride kidnappings has increased with the rise of Salafist networks under president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who pay as much as $3000 for every Coptic Christian woman kidnapped, raped and married to a Muslim man.<br><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-size: 28px;">ETHIOPIA</span></div><div>Bride kidnapping is common in many regions of Ethiopia. A man working together with his friends may kidnap a girl or woman, sometimes using a horse to escape. The abductor will then hide his intended bride or bring her to his family and rape her, sometimes in front of his family, until she becomes pregnant. As the father of her child, the man can claim her as his wife. He can also try to negotiate a bride price with village elders to legitimize the marriage.</div><div><br></div><div>Girls as young as eleven years old are reported to be kidnapped for the purpose of marriage.</div><div><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-size: 28px;">KENYA</span></div><div>Young teenage girls from age ten and up are sometimes married to men two decades older. Marriage by abduction used to be customary practice for some tribes. A man would kidnap the woman forcibly and rape her in an attempt to impregnate her. The "bride" is coerced through the stigma of pregnancy and rape to marry her abductor. A successful bridal kidnapping might raise the abductor's reputation in his community and allow him to negotiate a lower bride price with his wife's family. Should an attempt at seizure fail, he was bound to pay the bride price, provide additional gifts and have an arranged marriage.</div><div><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-size: 28px;">RWANDA</span></div><div>Bride kidnapping is not specifically outlawed in Rwanda. At the marriage ceremony that follows by several days, the abductor asks his bride's parents to forgive him for abducting their daughter â€“ he may offer a cow, money, or other goods as restitution. Around one third of men who abduct their wives abandon them. Additionaly, some men choose to not solemnize their marriage at all, keeping their "bride" as concubine.</div><div><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-size: 28px;">CHINA</span></div><div>In recent years bride kidnapping has resurfaced in areas of China. Reports say that buying a kidnapped bride is nearly just 10% the price of hosting a traditional wedding. This trend might've been affected by China's one child policy and consequent gender imbalance.</div>
