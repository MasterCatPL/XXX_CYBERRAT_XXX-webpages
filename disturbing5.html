There were estimated 50 000 to 200 000 women used for "military comfort", around 80% of them coming from Korea. Rare ethnic groups, such as Dutch or other European, were reserved to be raped only by higher ranking officers of the Japanese Army.</div><div><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-size: 28px;">THE JAPANESE MILITARY BROTHELS</span></div><div>Originally, the brothels were created to provide soldiers with voluntary prostitues in order to reduce the amount of war rape, a cause of rising anti-Japanese sentiment accross occupied territories. Instead of achievieng their goal, comfort stations only worsened the situation – they greatly increased the rate of rape and institutionalized it, making the soldiers feel less guilty about forcefully fulfilling their sexual needs. It made rape feel... less criminal. Something they were entitled to. At the end, they were soldiers, so they felt they deserved some "comfort" in exchange for risking their lives.</div><div><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-size: 28px;">SEXUAL SLAVERY</span></div><div>Many women were forced or manipulated into working in the brothels – in many cases, local middlemen tasked with acquiring "voluntary" prostitutes for the military often disguised themselves as recruiters with promises of work in factories, restaurants or nursing jobs at Japanese army bases; once recruited, they were forced into the military brothels. A significant percentage of comfort women were minors.</div><div><br></div><div><font color="#ff0000"><span style="font-size: 28px;">TREATMENT OF COMFORT WOMEN</span></font></div><div>It's estimated as many as 75% of Korean comfort women may have died during the war. According to an account by a survivor, she was beaten when she attempted to resist being raped. The women who were not prostitutes prior to joining the comfort women, those who were either deceived by the recruiters or taken by force, were normally "broken in" by being raped.</div><div><br></div><div><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-size: 28px;">WITNESS TESTIMONY</span></div><div>One Korean woman, Kim Hak-sun, stated in a 1991 interview about how she was drafted into the "comfort women corps" in 1941: "When I was 17 years old, the Japanese soldiers came along in a truck, beat us [her and a friend], and then dragged us into the back. I was told if I were drafted, I could earn lots of money in a textile factory ... The first day I was raped and the rapes never stopped ... I was born a woman but never lived as a woman ... I feel sick when I come close to a man. Not just Japanese men, but all men-even my own husband who saved me from the brothel. I shiver whenever I see a Japanese flag ... Why should I feel ashamed? I don't have to feel ashamed." Kim stated that she was raped 30–40 times a day, every day of the year during her time as a "comfort woman".</div>
