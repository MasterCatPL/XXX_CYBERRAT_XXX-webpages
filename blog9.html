<div id="MAIN">
<p>My name is Lisa and I work a minimum wage job at a second-hand clothing store. It doesn't pay much, and it's hard work. I'm on my feet all day, and I barely have time to rest. I barely have enough money to pay my rent, and I have to go without food or other necessities just to make ends meet.</p>

<p>I'm barely getting by, and I'm always one step away from falling behind. I'm constantly stressed out and worried, and I don't know how much longer I can keep this up.</p>

<p>I barely have enough money to pay my rent, and I'm always worried about falling behind. I don't have any savings, and I don't have anyone to turn to for help. I'm all alone, and I'm struggling to make ends meet.</p>

<img src="CSS/Images/Anxiety/Blog9_1.png" class="IMAGE">

<p>It's tough, and it's frustrating. I feel like I'm working hard and not getting anywhere. I feel like I'm stuck in a rut, and I don't know how to get out.</p>

<p>I wish I had more money, but I don't know how to get it. I wish I had a better job, but I don't know how to get one. I'm stuck, and I don't know what to do.</p>

<p>Last month was the first time I wasn't able to pay for rent. I was completely out of money, and I was desperate. I didn't know what to do, and I was afraid of being evicted. That's when my landlord, a middle-aged man, offered me a deal. He said that he would forgive my debt in exchange for sexual favors</p>

<img src="CSS/Images/Anxiety/Blog9_2.png" class="IMAGE">

<p>I was shocked and disgusted, but I didn't know what else to do. I was out of options, and I was afraid of being homeless. So I accepted his offer, and I did what he asked.</p>

<p>Afterwards, I felt sick to my stomach. I felt like my dignity had been stolen from me, and I was filled with regret. I knew that I had made a terrible mistake, and I wished that I could go back in time and make a different choice.</p>

<p>I started to hate my landlord after what he did to me. I couldn't believe that he had taken advantage of me like that, and I was filled with rage and disgust. I wanted to hurt him, to make him pay for what he had done.</p>

<img src="CSS/Images/Anxiety/Blog9_3.png" class="IMAGE">

<p>I started to plan his death. I thought about all the different ways I could do it, and I spent hours researching how I can do it. I was willing to do whatever it took to get my revenge. To make him pay.</p>

<p>Today was the day I buried his body in the forest.</p>

<p>It almost felt like burying my own shame and regret for what I did.</p>

<p>Now, nobody besides me knows this happened. It's kept secret. I don't regret anything. If I had the choice, I would kill him again. More than that. If I could go back, I'd kill him more slowly, more painfully. The scumbag deserves it.</p>
