<div id="MAIN">
<p>I'm a 50 years old, hard working man from Libanon. Just a couple of years from my retirement. I've been saving up money for 30 years. It wasn't easy. I had to work hard and make sacrifices, but I was determined to do it. I knew that if I was careful and disciplined, I could build a secure future for not only myself but most importantly, my children.</p>

<p>I worked long hours at my job, and I didn't spend much. I didn't go out to eat, and I didn't buy new clothes. I lived frugally, always putting my money into my savings account at the bank.</p>

<p>I was careful and I was disciplined, and I never let myself get tempted by the things that other people had. I was content with what I had, and I was happy to save my money for the future.</p>

<img src="CSS/Images/Anxiety/Blog8_1.png" class="IMAGE">

<p>It wasn't always easy. There were times when I was tired and I just wanted to relax. There were times when I saw something that I really wanted, and it was hard to resist the temptation to buy it.</p>

<p>But I persevered. I knew that if I was going to achieve my goal, I had to be strong. And in the end, it was all worth it. I had saved a significant sum of money, and I was proud of what I had accomplished.</p>

<p>Several months ago, everything has changed. The banking system of the country collapsed, and people were only able to withdraw a small amount of money from their accounts. I was shocked and confused, and I didn't know what to do.</p>

<img src="CSS/Images/Anxiety/Blog8_2.png" class="IMAGE">

<p>I went to the bank and tried to get my money, but there simply wasn't enough to go around. The teller told me that there was a limit on how much I could withdraw, and that I would have to wait until the situation improved.</p>

<p>But as the weeks went by, it became clear that there wasn't enough money to pay everyone. The enormity of what was happening hit me like a ton of bricks. All of the money I had saved up during those 40 years was just gone, and there was no way I would ever get it back.</p>

<img src="CSS/Images/Anxiety/Blog8_3.png" class="IMAGE">

<p>I hate my government. I hate them for what they've done to me, and I hate them for what they've done to my country They promised us stability and security, and they delivered nothing but chaos and destruction.</p>

<p>How could they do this to me? How could they let this happen? I paid my taxes to them, so much taxes during the 40 work years, and all I wanted in return was just a stable future...</p>

<p>I want revenge. I want to make them pay for what they had done. I've already started plotting and scheming, trying to come up with a way to get even. I am willing to do whatever it took to make them pay. If you're from Libanon and feel the same, hit me up. We'll do it together.</p>
